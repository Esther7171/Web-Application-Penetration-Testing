Server-side topics
For complete beginners, we recommend starting with our server-side topics. These vulnerabilities are typically easier to learn because you only need to understand what's happening on the server. Our materials and labs will help you develop some of the core knowledge and skills that you will rely on time after time.

* SQL injection
* Authentication
