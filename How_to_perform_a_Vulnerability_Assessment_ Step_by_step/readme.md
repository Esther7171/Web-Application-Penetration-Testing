# How to preform a Vulnerability Assesment Step by step

1. Authentication

For white box testing of an authentication page.

1. user account
2. Example i have a account `Esther` and password is `Admin@123`.
3. I will create a wordlist  2 differnty 1 for user and 2nd for password ,like about 10 words that dosn't make more load on server. and include your username and passowd either on 6th postion or 8th postion.

In first case use Sniper attack at `username` field to check, even if the password is Invalde the login page authorising the username by any differece in `length`, `response time`.
